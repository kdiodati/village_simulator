This week we continued to brainstorm ideas for our game and discussing the details of each element.
We created a basic file hierarchy layout, as well as some basic ideas of how to accomplish each element.
Most of our time has been on getting on the same page about the implementation of our project, making
sure that we are all happy with what we are creating, and that all of our ideas are included. The real
work will begin after we finish our final programming assignment in this course.
